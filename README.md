## Overview

This repository contains the working draft of a theoretical framework titled **Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT)**. The model proposes a deterministic mechanism for resolving internal contradictions in symbolic systems by introducing a self-propagating collapse field (Φ), which flows through a bipartite graph of symbols and constraints. This work is part of a much bigger project revolving cognition. 

The work is fully self-contained in the PDF below.  
It does not rely on neural networks, optimization solvers, or external training. All dynamics are internally defined and recursively applied.

## Included

- `main.pdf`: Full paper outlining the mathematical formalism, simulations, and philosophical implications of RCT.
- No implementation or source code is included in this repository.  
- No claim of complete empirical validation is made.

## Purpose

This release is for **open scientific review**.  
The goal is to:

- Share the core formalism for scrutiny and refinement.
- Explore its possible relevance in symbolic AI, logic compression, and recursive computation.
- Begin dialogue with researchers interested in tension-driven symbolic systems.
