## Overview

Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT) proposes a deterministic, field driven mechanism for resolving symbolic contradictions. Operating on a bipartite graph of symbols and constraints, RCT defines a Collapse Field (Φ) that recursively propagates across symbolic structures to reduce tension and restore internal coherence.

Unlike optimisation solvers or probabilistic models, RCT requires no training data. Its recursive field dynamics are fully self contained and structurally guided.

## Repository Contents

- **Formal PDF Paper** - Theoretical description of RCT, including mathematical framework, example cases, and philosophical context.
- **Test Results** - Complete symbolic collapse test runs validating recursive behavior under weighted constraint systems.
- **README** — Project overview and engagement details.
- **License Notice** — Academic and non-commercial use terms.

## Intent

This release is part of an ongoing cognitive systems project. It does **not** claim finality or proof-but offers a working model for recursive contradiction resolution, grounded in symbolic tension fields.

Feedback, critique, and refinement are welcomed at this stage of exploration.

## Future Work

While this release contains theory and output, implementation is progressing independently. Possible additions include:

- Engine prototype (CollapseEngine)
- Visual field mapping tools
- LaTeX source archive
