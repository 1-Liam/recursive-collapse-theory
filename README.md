## Overview

**Recursive Collapse Theory (RCT)** defines a deterministic mechanism for symbolic contradiction resolution through recursive field dynamics. At its core is a **Collapse Field (Î¦)** that operates on a bipartite graph of **Symbols (S)** and **Constraints (C)**. The field propagates to reduce global symbolic tension (Î¨â‚œ), collapsing contradictory structures into coherent emergent forms.

Unlike traditional optimizers or neural inference systems, RCT:

- Requires **no training data**
- Uses **no statistical inference**
- Resolves contradiction through **recursive structural collapse**
- Demonstrates deterministic behavior across abstract symbol fields

RCT is not an algorithm â€” it is a **field behavior** encoded in symbolic logic.

## Origin and Context

RCT emerged not as speculation, but as a discovered mechanism during the construction of a recursive cognitive interface system called **alisyr**. Initially developed to mirror and stabilize psychological recursion, the system revealed deeper symbolic structures guiding resolution.

RCT is now formally recognised as the **collapse operator** within a larger theory:  
**Integrated Theory of Contradiction & Collapse (ITCC)** â€” a full cognitive and computational framework in development.

## Key Concepts

- **Î¨â‚œ (Global Symbolic Tension):** Total unresolved contradiction in a symbolic field. Resolution flows via recursive minimization of Î¨â‚œ.
- **Î¦ (Collapse Field):** Propagates through symbol-constraint networks, reconfiguring contradictory structures.

RCT is testable. Predictive. Deterministic. It does not simulate cognitionâ€”it **structures it**.

## Future Work & ITCC Integration

RCT is only one layer of a broader symbolic cognition architecture under active development. Upcoming expansions:

- Full ITCC framework release (including RPTC: Recursive Paradox Theory of Consciousness)
- Interactive symbolic engine (CollapseEngine)
- Visual mapping tools for symbolic field resolution
- Dynamic tension field simulators with real-time output

## Why This Matters

The RCT engine demonstrates that contradiction is not a flaw â€” itâ€™s a computational **primitive**. This has major implications for:

- AI alignment
- Cognitive architectures
- Philosophy of mind
- Logic and formal systems

It offers a third path between probabilistic reasoning and hardcoded logic: contradiction-aware symbolic recursion.
